This is a checklist for integrating a new developer into the team.

 * Commit rights: add their GitHub account to the DCSS group.
 * Add them to .mailmap (in the repository root) and CREDITS.txt.
 * Upgrade their Mantis account to developer.
 * Update the wiki listing:
        https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:admin:devteam
 * Add them to the committer group on Libera IRC:
        /msg chanserv flags #crawl-dev NICK committer
   They should first register with NickServ (/msg nickserv help register) to
   prevent others from using that nick.  /msg nickserv info NICK  will show an
   "account" field if they are registered.
 * Upgrade their Crawl server accounts (CAO, CDO, et al) to administrator. This
   lets them use wizmode, and on most servers gives them access to save backups
   and the rebuild trigger:
        dgl admin add <username>
 * Create a WordPress account for them.
 * On the Tavern, add them to the Dungeon Master group.
 * Ask advil or |amethyst to add them to the private mailing list.
 * Send an announcement/welcome message on the crawl.develz.org Dev Blog.
