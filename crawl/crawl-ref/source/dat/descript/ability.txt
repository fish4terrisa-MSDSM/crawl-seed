user becomes unable to cast spells.

Return to life, transitioning from bloodless to alive. This process renders
the user temporarily frail.

or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Word of Chaos ability

Speaks a word of chaos, forcing enemies nearby to blink away from the user.
Additionally, those affected may be slowed, ensnared, or terrified by the
experience. Invoking a word of chaos is no easy feat and will drain the user's
maximum health somewhat, and the ability then cannot be used again for a short
time.
%%%%
Heal Wounds ability

Heals the user significantly, with a chance of permanently reducing the user's
maximum magic capacity by one.
%%%%
Dig ability

Allows making tunnels through soft rock and rusted grates. Activating the
ability has no cost and simply prepares you to start digging; once active,
moving into a wall will start tunnelling. Doing so makes some noise and drains
the user's maximum health.

Once active, activating the ability again or making any non-digging movement
action will cancel the Dig status.
%%%%
Shaft Self ability

Sends you to a random position one to three floors down, as if you jumped into
a shaft trap. It takes some time to dig the shaft.

on Evocations skill.
%%%%

# Zin
Recite ability

Preaches to nearby monsters about Zin's laws for a short duration. After
finishing a recitation, it cannot be repeated for a short time.

The recitation will have different effects depending on the target: the chaotic
and unclean will be affected by powerful and damaging effects, undead and
demons will be affected by weaker rebukes, and any other intelligent creatures
will have confusion sown amongst them, with heretics and priests of gods other
than Zin being punished much more strongly. The effectiveness of the recitation
is increased by Invocations skill and piety.
%%%%
Vitalisation ability

Temporarily provides protection from poison, confusion, petrification, and
sickness, as well as the effects of clouds of foul pestilence. Your strength,
intelligence and dexterity are also temporarily increased by a degree dependent

undead and demons and dealing damage to all other hostile creatures. The power
of the blast is increased by Invocations skill.

One. Demon weapons will be converted into a more powerful sacred weapon. This
blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on artefact weapons.

fodder for all kinds of necromancy. Their number and quality is dependent on
Necromancy skill.
%%%%

pain some poor soul suffered in its entire life. This damage is never directly
lethal. Kikubaaqudgha will always at least partially shield you from the effect.

abilities it had in life.

Living, holy and demonic monsters can be targeted (excepting most lords of
Pandemonium), as long as they are relatively uninjured. The duration of the mark
is dependent on Invocations skill.

The bound soul will follow its captor through stairs, and can be recalled from

# Trog
Berserk ability

Sends the user into a berserk rage. Going berserk temporarily increases health,
speed, and damage dealt in melee. It will time out quickly outside of combat,
but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, almost all actions other
than movement and melee combat are prevented. When the rage expires, the user
will be slowed and unable to berserk again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand ability

%%%%
# Elyvilon

sickness. Any drained strength, dexterity or intelligence will also be fully
restored, along with any drained maximum health.
%%%%
Heal Other ability

Heals a creature other than yourself by a moderate amount, depending on
Invocations skill. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to turn them
neutral. This works best on living creatures, with the undead and demons being
progressively harder to pacify. Intelligent creatures are also more difficult
to pacify.

Ghosts of dead adventurers and demon lords are too wrathful to be pacified,
mindless creatures are too unintelligent to be pacified, and no monster can be
pacified while it is asleep.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested piety and magic points
are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain the monster's
full experience value. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you gain
nothing.
%%%%
Heal Self ability

Heals a moderate amount of health, depending on Invocations skill.
%%%%
Divine Vigour ability

entered it.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempts to banish a creature into the Abyss. If the attempt succeeds, you gain
some piety and the creature's full experience value. Even creatures that resist
are left malmutated and weakened by the brush with the Abyss. Invocations skill
makes Banishment harder to resist.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupts the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will
cause the area nearby to change appearance, and will gate in creatures from the
Abyss bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already
corrupted or in the Abyss itself. The size of the effect is increased by
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transports you to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health depleted.
%%%%

artefact weapons.

well as the damage of its exploding spores.
%%%%

may then become uninterested in fighting you (with tougher inhabitants having
an increasing chance of being bribed), and more rarely will join your ranks,

lower the remaining bribe fund; upon its exhaustion, bribed enemies will become
indifferent if they have not become your allies.

Sacrifices the ability to evoke any magical items, and prevents you from having
any ranks in the Evocations skill.

*not* affect reaching weapons, talismans, and ziggurat figurines. This also renders
magical staves much less effective in melee.
%%%%

by you. Monsters that are spell residue and which do not act independently,
such as orbs of destruction and spectral weapons, are the only things which can

monsters fill you with horror, which reduces the power of your spells and your

Renounces your faith. This will make you leave your god (and usually anger
said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh ability

non-believers must die, but new believers must be spared and accepted into the
fold. Beware, for orcs who do not see you convert may still be hostile until
you have built your reputation!

All other gods hate Beogh, and do not take desertion lightly.
%%%%
Donate Gold ability

overall increase is determined by the size of your donation.
%%%%
Recall Ancestor ability

Recalls your ancestor from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.

Idealise ability

Restores your ancestor to an idyllic vision of their best self. Their wounds

Invocations skill.
%%%%

Allows you to move at supernatural speeds, making any normal movements up to a
distance of two tiles instant. Martial attacks performed under the effect of
Serpent's Lash are more damaging and never miss.
%%%%
Heavenly Storm ability

Invokes a storm of heavenly clouds. While the storm rages, your evasion and
combat accuracy and damage are substantially increased, and striking enemies
with martial attacks increases this bonus. The storm weakens over time and
fades away once the bonus reaches zero. The heavenly clouds prevent
invisibility, and obscure the vision of those outside the storm.
%%%%
Fiery Armour ability

Armour yourself in fire, providing +7 AC and searing foes foolish enough to
strike you in melee. The fire takes quite a long time to burn out.

ability, you will be unable to use it again for a short time.
%%%%

hostile before vanishing. The success of the ability scales with the Evocations
skill, and this ability is available only while wielding the Sceptre of
Asmodeus.
%%%%
Evoke Damnation ability

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation. These unholy forces harm the victim and
anyone adjacent, and are not affected by any means of protection, such as armour
or resistances. However, certain creatures, usually those able to invoke
damnation themselves, are entirely unscathed by damnation. The power of this
ability scales with the Evocations skill.
%%%%
Evoke the Staff of Olgreb ability

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the aura lasts. The power of this
ability scales with the Evocations skill, and this ability is available only
while wielding the Staff of Olgreb.
