vertigo briefly if they successfully make contact with other minds. It is
frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Anguish spell

Afflicts nearby foes with supernatural anguish, causing all damage they deal to
rebound on them for the duration of the effect. Strong-willed foes can resist the
necromantic visions of pain and suffering, and mindless creatures are unaffected.
%%%%

Call upon the spirit of your worn armour to fight alongside you. The spirit moves
slowly, but draws strength from the inherent protection of your own armour. At
higher power, the spirit becomes more durable.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

For some time after casting this, living creatures killed by the caster will rise
as zombies. The chance of reanimating a monster and the duration of the effect
increase with spell power. Re-casting this spell will return zombies to dust, as
will leaving the floor.
%%%%
Apportation spell

Pulls the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor
near the caster. With low power, items might not be moved all the way to the
caster's position.

Extremely powerful magical items, such as the Orb of Zot, may actively resist
the pull of this spell.
%%%%

Empowers the magic of nearby wizard allies of the caster, allowing them to

caster staggering backwards.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
damages their health, to a degree dependent on (and inversely related to) power.

It is powerful enough to cancel the effects of Death's Door, although doing so
will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Vile Clutch spell

Calls forth hands from corpses interred beneath the dungeon floor long ago.
Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they
break free.
%%%%

with no direct line of fire required. If the enemy has near-emptied magic
reserves, they will take doubled damage.
%%%%
Brom's Barrelling Boulder spell

Unleashes a massive rolling boulder in a given cardinal direction. The boulder
squashes and knocks back creatures it strikes, suffering wear and tear with each
hit. If it strikes a wall, it will explode into fragments of rock, doing damage
that is strongly reduced by armour.

The boulder sometimes veers from side to side, and will disintegrate if it leaves
the caster's sight.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms spell

<Brothers in Arms ability>
%%%%
Call Canine Familiar spell

Summons an inugami to the caster's aid. These mystical canines form a bond with
their summoner, strengthening them in direct proportion with the caster's
spellpower.

Recasting this spell while your familiar is nearby will imbue it with additional
magic, mending some of its wounds and causing its next attack to strike more
quickly and cleave adjacent foes.
%%%%
Call Down Damnation spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with damnation, with no direct line of fire required.
These unholy forces harm the victim and anyone adjacent, and are not affected
by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain
creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely
unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Call Down Lightning spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with lightning, with no direct line of fire required.
The targeting magics need distance to function, so enemies that are adjacent
or nearly adjacent cannot be struck by this.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

Calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell, equipped with a spear with
which to jab at the caster's enemies. The quality of the imp's weaponry rises
with spell power.
%%%%

powerful undead to bring them back from brink of demise, or turn dying living
creatures into ghostly versions of themselves.
%%%%
Call of Chaos spell

Calls upon the powers of chaos to empower nearby allies, granting them haste,
might, agility, or improved resistances. The chaotic magic may occasionally
backfire and cause allies to instead lose their willpower or be berserked,
polymorphed, or filled with inner flame.
%%%%
Call Tide spell

Allows the caster to affect the tidal phase of all water within a large
distance. Soon after calling it, the waters on the whole level will reach high
tide. Waters near the caster will reach even higher levels than they would
normally.
%%%%
Cantrip spell

Casts one of a number of minor spells, aimed at trying to bolster the caster's
morale. They have no noticeable effect.
%%%%
Cause Fear spell

approach the caster, and to sometimes fail to attack them in melee. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Chain of Chaos spell

Creates an arc of pure chaos, striking nearby creatures with unpredictable
effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

Releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs to the creature nearest the
caster and then outward from it. The further it travels, the less damage it
does. Secondary arcs have limited range and do little damage to the caster.
The spell bypasses half of defenders' armour and resistance to electricity.
%%%%
Charm spell

Causes an otherwise hostile creature to fight on the caster's side for a while.
%%%%
Chaos Breath spell

Exhales a large cloud of fumes filled with the very essence of chaos.
%%%%
Chilling Breath spell

Exhales a blast of frost which may knock the target back if it deals damage.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot spell

Rots away a part of the caster's flesh to produce a cloud of miasma around them.
The miasma slows and powerfully poisons any living creature that lingers within -
including the caster, if they tarry after casting. Most living creatures are
terrified of miasma and will not willingly enter it.

The rot leaves the caster's health temporarily drained. The undead can still use
this spell, but fleshless beings (e.g., those made of stone) cannot.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

<Cleansing Flame ability>
%%%%
Cold Breath spell

Exhales a focused blast of icy-cold air.
%%%%
Concentrate Venom spell

become intense enough to slow and asphyxiate.
%%%%
Confuse spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

Enchants the caster's dominant hand with magical energy. This energy is
released when the caster touches a monster, and may induce a state of confusion
in the monster. The caster's attacks do no damage while attempting to touch a
monster in this way.
%%%%
Confusion Gaze spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. The damage dealt bypasses half of
defenders' armour. Casters are advised to use caution; the lightning is not
mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Living Spells spell

Creates several living, autonomous spells, which cast themselves at the first foe
to enter their range. Once cast, they dissipate.
%%%%
Corona spell

This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid.
%%%%
Corrupt spell

Unleashes Abyssal energies in the immediate vicinity. This changes the
appearance of the affected area and temporarily summons creatures from the
Abyss. This cannot be used in the Abyss itself.
%%%%
Corrupting Pulse spell

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the
undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Creeping Frost spell

Calls forth freezing cold from the walls. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to the walls will be frozen and will find their movements slowed. Cold
resistance will reduce damage, but not prevent the freezing effect.
%%%%
Crystal Bolt spell

Projects a penetrating projectile with peculiar magical properties. It is
randomly imbued with either fire or ice, and additionally will reflect from
walls of any material due to the crystal embedded in the shot.
%%%%
Curse of Agony spell

Curses a foe, halving their remaining health after the next two times that
the caster strikes them in melee.
%%%%
Dazzling Flash spell

The caster erupts in a scintillating display of light. Any living, demonic
or angelic creature nearby may be dazzled and left stumbling blindly.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

Binds the souls of slain living, demonic and holy creatures, forcing their
spectres to remain and fight for the caster for as long as the channel lasts.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left further from death when the effect ends. It has no effect on those
who are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%

Blocks any translocations attempted by the affected target, be they voluntary
or not. This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not
Banishment.
%%%%

Weaves a link between the caster's weaponry and a chosen target. Whenever the
caster fires or throws something at a *different* enemy, a matching projectile
will be teleported at the target. Spellpower increases their accuracy.
%%%%
Discord spell

Drives nearby creatures into an wild frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilizes the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an adjacent undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces
binding it together.
%%%%
Dispel Undead Range spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature with the Will to resist will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a separate Will-based chance
of being confused by the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon
to engage the summoner's enemies. The spell is taxing to maintain, and each new
dragon which answers the call will further drain the summoner's magical
reserves. After the call ends, it cannot be issued again for a short time. The
duration of the call and the species of dragons called depend on spell power.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

Drains the life force of any nearby creatures, healing the user depending on
the damage dealt.
%%%%
Drain Magic spell

Causes the target's magic to leak into the air, as though they were hit by an
antimagic weapon.

antimagic weapon, and heals the caster for the amount of magic drained,
with no direct line of fire required.

enchanting visual display. Additional dream sheep will increase the strength
and duration of this effect.

Druid's Call spell

Recalls woodland creatures from elsewhere on the same level.
%%%%
Electrical Bolt spell

Throws a bolt of electricity at the target, with high accuracy.
%%%%

Overwhelms an enemy with malignant energies, irresistibly weakening their melee
attacks and disrupting their magic. It will additionally daze and blind any foe
that fails to resist the full force of the curse.
%%%%
Ensnare spell

Shoots a stream of webbing at a creature, ensnaring the target in a sticky web.
%%%%
Ensorcelled Hibernation spell

Lowers its target's metabolic rate, inducing hibernation. After awakening, the
target will be unable to be put to sleep again for some time.
%%%%
Entropic Weave spell

Corrodes the target, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Eringya's Noxious Bog spell

Causes the caster to release a torrent of sludge that transforms nearby areas
into a toxic bog. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those
resistant to poison. The bog cannot form on areas adjacent to multiple solid
features, nor on areas that lack solid floor, like deep water or lava. The
transformation is temporary and cannot be sustained out of the caster's sight.
Spellpower will increase how long the bog lingers.
%%%%
Eruption spell

Splits the earth to draw up a localized, short-lived volcano under the target.
%%%%
Flay spell

Opens painful illusionary wounds on the target's body, which disappear after
a short time or on the death of the caster. This cannot kill directly, and is
ineffective against unnatural targets.
%%%%
Fire Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Fire Storm spell

Calls forth a mighty storm of roaring flame directly onto the target, dealing
damage in a large area and leaving behind short-lived fire vortices. Half of
its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Fire Summon spell

Summons demons of flame and damnation.
%%%%
Fireball spell

Hurls an explosive ball of fire.
%%%%
Flame Wave spell

Blasts the caster's surroundings with a wave of fire. If the caster maintains
focus and supplies the spell with magical power (by waiting in place and not
taking any other actions), more and larger flame waves will radiate outward.
%%%%
Flaming Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of roaring flames.
%%%%
Flash Freeze spell

Freezes the air around a target, causing significant harm and slowing the
target's movement. Half of its damage bypasses cold resistance. It has no
effect on targets that are already frozen.
%%%%
Force Lance spell

Fires a shaft of concussive force. If the impact deals damage, it may knock the
target back.
%%%%
Forceful Invitation spell

Summons some creatures from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest, the Swamp,
the Shoals, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, or the Crypt; the specific branch
varies with the caster.
%%%%
Foxfire spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. They will dissipate harmlessly
if unable to reach a target or if the caster swaps places with them.
%%%%
Freeze spell

Freezes an adjacent creature, dealing damage that bypasses any armour the
target may have. This may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%
Frozen Ramparts spell

Encases surrounding walls with ice for a short time. Foes that wander near the
icy walls will be damaged, and this may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
Each victim is only ever affected by one icy wall at a time.

The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position.
%%%%
Fugue of the Fallen spell

Calls out to the lingering remnants of the long dead. While active, each
non-summoned enemy the caster or their allies slays attracts more vengeful
souls into the caster's weapon, temporarily enhancing their melee and ranged
effectiveness. When this bonus reaches its maximum, every hit will unleash a
glimmer of the dead's suffering, causing pain damage to each other foe adjacent
to your target.

Recasting this spell will release your grip on the souls you've attracted,
resetting any bonus you've accumulated, and the cacophonous wailing of the dead
may attract unwanted attention even while you maintain it.
%%%%
Fulminant Prism spell

Conjures a prism which unleashes a violent explosion of arcane force after a
short duration. If destroyed prematurely, its blast will be much weaker.
%%%%
Funeral Dirge spell

A ritual chant that briefly rouses several nearby undead allies to move more
swiftly and strike with greater might.
%%%%
Gell's Gravitas spell

Briefly redirects gravity around a target point, causing 'down' to be towards
that point. All nearby creatures, save the caster, fall helplessly toward that
point – typically colliding with each other, or with a victim standing there.
%%%%
Ghostly Fireball spell

Hurls an exploding ball of negative energy which drains any living creature
it engulfs.
%%%%
Ghostly Sacrifice spell

Uses an ally's motivating essence to create a blast of negative energy,
draining any living creature it engulfs. The being used to fuel the spell, no
matter whether living or construct, is consumed and unmade in the process.
%%%%
Glaciate spell

Conjures forth a mighty blast of ice. Creatures within its cone-shaped area of
effect take damage, with higher damage being dealt to those close to the
caster. Those hit by the blast are encased in ice, slowing their movement, and
those killed by the blast may be frozen into solid blocks of ice. Half of its
damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Grasping Roots spell

Calls giant grasping roots from deep underground that hold and constrict their
victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves
out of view.
%%%%
Greater Servant of Makhleb spell

Summons a major demon.
%%%%
Hailstorm spell

Conjures a cannonade of hail, battering nearby creatures that fail to dodge.
The eye of the storm is wide enough that monsters adjacent to the caster are
unaffected. Due to the strong impact and cutting edges, half of its damage
bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Haste Other spell

Speeds the actions of a nearby ally.
%%%%
Harpoon Shot spell

Fires a long and flexible barbed mass. The ensnared victim will either be
pulled adjacent to the caster or collide with anything blocking the way.
%%%%
Haste spell

Speeds the actions of the caster.
%%%%
Haunt spell

%%%%
Hunting Call spell

Inspires nearby allies to quicken their movement.
%%%%
Hurl Damnation spell

<Hurl Damnation ability>

drenching their surroundings. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters,
even those resistant to poison.
%%%%

Exhales a large cloud of blessed flame, shining with the glory of the good
gods. These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures,
and have no effect on holy creatures.
%%%%
Holy Flames spell

Traps an enemy in a ring of blessed flame. These flames are especially
dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The
caster is not affected directly.
%%%%
Ignition spell

All foes in the caster's surroundings are engulfed in balls of fire. The caster
and their allies are protected from the fire and will never be harmed by this
spell.

%%%%
Infestation spell

Calls forth a plague of scarabs, infesting affected creatures for a duration
depending on power and causing death scarabs to grow and burst from them upon
death.
%%%%

to the caster.
%%%%

Reflects damage taken for a short duration, hurting attackers whenever any
damage is taken.
%%%%
Ink Cloud spell

Releases a thick cloud of ink to obscure vision.
%%%%

is hit, and explosively released upon death. The size of the explosion caused
is dependent on the size of the target.
%%%%
Invisibility spell

Turns the caster invisible.
%%%%
Invisibility Other spell

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It may heavily deform
its victims, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected; some of the magic lingers, enough to leave them
dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy. Each time its creator casts a
destructive spell (other than Battlesphere itself or Spellforged Servitor), the
battlesphere will launch its own volley of energy at a random foe. With
increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer and deals more damage per
volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Detonates a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The explosion will hit all
nearby monsters with physical force, knocking them back if damage is done.
%%%%
Jinxbite spell

Calls the attention of trickster spirits. While it holds, the spirits will
follow up on the caster's attacks. If the spell overcomes victims' willpower,
they will suffer minor damage and be drained by the sprites' playful malice.

Fae assistance is fickle, however; they cannot be beckoned unless a susceptible
victim is visible, and will depart rapidly once no more remain. Calling on the
fae also reduces the caster's own willpower for a time.
%%%%
Volatile Blastmotes spell

Brings forth a cloud of volatile blastmotes around the caster. These explode
on contact with open flame or with creatures - including any caster foolish
enough to linger in them! The explosion is concussive, knocking adjacent
creatures away. Damage done rises with the spell's power.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and creatures stuck in
the liquefied ground will be unable to fly. Attempts to attack the caster
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out. Maintaining the
connection to the ground slows the caster's movement, even if they are flying.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

Targets made from rock, stone, ice or bone will cause a small explosion. Metal
targets will cause a small but more damaging explosion, and targets made from
crystal will cause a large and more damaging explosion.
%%%%
Legendary Destruction spell

Conjures two explosive magical effects in instant succession. The effects can
be any mix of Fireball, Iceblast, and Ghostly Fireball.
%%%%
Lehudib's Crystal Spear spell

Hurls a lethally sharp shard of crystal.
%%%%
Lesser Beckoning spell

Beckons the target forward, attempting to place them adjacent to the caster.

armour, and it can be bounced off walls to hit targets twice.
%%%%
Magic Dart spell

Fires a small bolt of magical energy which never misses.
%%%%
Major Destruction spell

Shoots a random harmful beam or explosion at the targeted creature.
%%%%
Major Healing spell

Heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Malign Gateway spell

Tears a gash in reality, creating a self-sustained but temporary portal to an
unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound
to the caster's will for a duration depending on power. With the portal's
expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster. The duration of
the portal increases with spell power.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.
%%%%
Malmutate spell

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Manifold Assault spell

Warps space into paradoxical configurations to strike many visible foes with
one melee attack. Power increases the number of foes attacked with one cast,
but very high power is required to launch multiple unarmed attacks in this
fashion, since great care must be taken when warping one's own limbs.

The time taken for the attack is exactly the same as a normal melee attack.
It's imprecise, so it can't do extra damage against unsuspecting foes.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
March of Sorrows spell

Conjures a stream of stolen suffering, leaving clouds of excruciating misery in
its wake and around its targets. These clouds of negative energy will rapidly
drain the living of small fractions of their maximum health.
%%%%
Marshlight spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. Wizards attempted to copy this
with the spell 'Foxfire', but their version is much less powerful.
%%%%
Martyr's Knell spell

Beckons forth the soul of a long-dead martyr to shield your allies for a time.
This soul suffers a portion of the damage your allies would otherwise receive.

If it is slain (again!), it will transform into a flayed ghost, inflicting
illusory wounds on foes. Such wounds are fleeting, and will disappear when the
ghost departs - unless you kill its victims first.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling spell

Gradually builds up electric charge in the caster, so long as they maintain
focus (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions). When a threshold
is reached, the charge couples with the nearest foe, vaporising them instantly.
Higher spell power will allow the caster to accumulate charge more rapidly.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures up a short-lived cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion in
any creature not resistant to poison. Tougher, more experienced creatures are
less likely to be affected.
%%%%
Mesmerise spell

Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

Lowers the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's vicinity, slowing
all those who are not resistant to cold. Cold-blooded creatures will be
affected much more strongly, and tougher creatures will be slowed for a
shorter time.
%%%%
Metal Splinters spell

Fires a burst of metal splinters. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Creates a large cloud of foul pestilence, poisoning and sometimes slowing any
living creatures it touches.
%%%%
Might Other spell

Significantly increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%
Might spell

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Mindburst spell

Launches a psychic attack. If it overcomes the victim's willpower, it
'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that
bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid: a manticore, a lindwurm,
or, at high power, even a sphinx. Casting the spell at higher power also
increases the strength of the beasts themselves.
%%%%
Mercury Vapours spell

Briefly transmutes the air around a target into gaseous mercury, poisoning those
who breathe it in. Further, the target and adjacent creatures (living or otherwise)
may be weakened by mere exposure to the alchemical substance.
%%%%
Mourning Wail spell

Exhales a stream of forgotten grief, leaving clouds of excruciating misery in
its wake but skipping past creatures that would be vulnerable to it. These
clouds of negative energy will rapidly drain the living of small fractions of
their maximum health.
%%%%
Necrotise spell

Agonizingly rots away the victim's flesh. Those slain by this spell (or otherwise
dying immediately afterward) may rise as skeletons to fight for the caster. Only
the living can be affected.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice, granting a
substantial bonus to armour as long as they remain in their current location.
The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position. The
spell decreases in effectiveness in heavier armour, granting a lower bonus the
higher the encumbrance rating of the caster's armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Turns the air bitterly cold, freezing all other creatures in line of sight.
This is less effective against creatures packed tightly together - those
adjacent to others will be partly insulated from the cold, taking less damage.
%%%%
Pain spell

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

Irresistibly prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time,
requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time. However,
gateways close a short time after being opened, or immediately once entered.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Allows the caster to travel a short distance through an adjacent rock wall and
emerge again on the other side. This spell takes an unusally long time to cast,
during which the caster will be unable to act, but also gain increased armour
from their attunement to the rock.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature and up to two other foes in a chain. Those which
do not muster the Will to resist are briefly slowed, and then turned to stone.
Until they return to flesh, they are unable to act, but also take half damage.
The spell's power is lessened against secondary targets.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Pits of Slime, the Elven
Halls, the Vaults, the Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the
specific branch varies with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Plasma Beam spell

Fires a penetrating beam of plasma at one of the caster's most distant foes.
The ionized beam bypasses half of defenders' armour, and a second beam of fire
follows in its wake.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Polar Vortex spell

Turns the air around the caster into a freezing vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it that can only be half-mitigated by resistance to
cold. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and tossed around.
Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. The
vortex is unable to follow the caster through long-distance translocations.
The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After the
vortex fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Teleports a fired or thrown missile at a targeted enemy.
%%%%
Primal Wave spell

Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a
pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Pyre Arrow spell

Launches a glob of liquid fire that clings to a targeted creature, dealing
armour-ignoring fire damage over multiple turns. The victim can put the fire out
much more quickly by moving.

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.
%%%%
Pyroclastic Surge spell

Draws searing flames from lava. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to or above lava will be burned.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Roll spell

Roll into a ball, granting the boulder beetle tremendous speed as well as
double melee damage. The roll may only be performed when at distance from a
foe, and the beetle will always unroll after an attempted roll attack.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Blasts a target with high-velocity rock shards. Gathering the rock from ambient
grit is slow, making this spell take one-and-a-half times as long to cast as
most. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition causes the target to lose access to their magic,
briefly preventing them from casting any further spells.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Scorch spell

Scorches a random foe. Those injured by this have their resistance to fire
burned away for a short time.
%%%%
Sculpt Simulacrum spell

Forms icy simulacra of an adjacent living, demonic, or holy creature. These
fragile doppelgangers will take shape over a short period of time, eventually
gaining the ability to move and attack the caster's enemies.

The good gods frown on this spell, as it works blood and ichor into unnatural
facsimiles.

You can maintain up to 5 simulacra simultaneously.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous piercing ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. So
long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and supplies it with magical
power (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions), the ray will
follow the caster's target if it should move.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Seracfall spell

Violently collapses a nearby simulacrum into a large mass of ice, which
explodes on impact. The ice affects even cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due
to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Sheza's Dance spell

Summons weapons from far and wide - a dagger newly forged, a sword long-rusted
in a moldering tomb, an axe still steaming with the blood of its victim -
animating them and sending them out to attack.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Sigil of Binding spell

Creates two sigils nearby. Anyone who passes over them will be bound, able to
act and dodge normally but unable to move away. When the effect wears off,
their movement speed will rebound, giving them temporary swiftness and preventing
subsequent binding effects.

Only one set of sigils can be maintained at a time and they will expire
prematurely if they leave your sight.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

Smites any targeted enemy within sight, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion. The strength of the servitor
increases with spell power.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature. Half of its damage bypasses fire resistance.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Splinterspray spell

Fires a burst of wooden splinters. Its damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sporulate spell

Releases a fast, gas-filled floating spore. After seeking out its foe, the
spore will explode, damaging anything caught in the blast and further confusing
living creatures.
%%%%
Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Starburst spell

Releases penetrating bolts of fire from the caster in every direction.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and the damage dealt
bypasses half of defenders' armour.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Unleashes a short-ranged spray of incendiary goo that clings to an adjacent
creature and deals armour-ignoring fire damage over several turns. If the victim
is allowed to move, it will put out the fire prematurely.

If the target is insubstantial, the liquid fire will fail to stick.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a polar vortex from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration
to maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Conjures a jagged shard of crystallized toxins. The stinger's impact will always
poison a susceptible target. Even resistant targets have a chance to be poisoned
and immune monsters will still be damaged by the physical impact of the stinger.
%%%%
Stoke Flames spell

Adds malice to hellish fires, binding it with flame into a creeping inferno.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Strip Willpower spell

Greatly reduces the target's willpower, making them more vulnerable to a
variety of magical effects.
%%%%
Stunning Burst spell

Fires a weak electrical burst which, on impact, causes very brief paralysis.
Willpower is of no use against this effect, but resistance to electricity can
sometimes prevent it.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

Converts some of the caster's blood into magical energy. The process is painful
but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%
Summon Air Elementals spell

Summons one or more air elementals.
%%%%
Summon Cactus Giant spell

Summons a warrior from a particularly prickly tribe. Foes that strike these
giants in melee are in for a painful surprise! When cast at a higher power,
older, more robust warriors will answer the call.
%%%%
Summon Demon spell

Opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its inhabitants

confuse, mutate or disintegrate.
%%%%
Summon Fire Elementals spell

Summons one or more fire elementals.
%%%%
Summon Forest spell

Forcefully intersects a forested plane with this world. It requires open space
to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,
and the trees of the forest will be awakened to deal damage to nearby enemies.
Spell power increases the duration, size, and thickness of the intersected
plane; as well as the strength of the spirit.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster.
%%%%
Summon Blazeheart Golem spell

Summons a volatile elemental spark encased in a shell of slag iron. It is
capable of raining down powerful blows on its summoner's adversaries - so
powerful that the golem itself is often damaged by their impact.

Only tenuously bound to this world, the flames within it will rapidly go
dormant whenever its summoner leaves its side. If its shell is ever destroyed
while still active, the exposed core will violently detonate a moment later.

It gains greater explosive damage at higher power.
%%%%

%%%%
Summon Holies spell

power.
%%%%
Summon Hydra spell

Summons a many-headed hydra to fight alongside the caster for a short time.
Spell power determines the number of heads.
%%%%
Summon Ice Beast spell

Calls forth a beast of ice to serve the caster. The strength of the beast

prowess as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
Summon Lightning Spire spell

of electricity at the caster's foes, but is completely immobile. The strength
of the spire depends on spell power.
%%%%

reserves of nearly any foe. At higher power, the antimagic properties of the
viper's bite grow even stronger.

Fires a shard of ice. Due to its strong impact and cutting edges, half of its

%%%%
Throw Klown Pie spell

Throws a harmful yet strangely delicious pie that can inflict its victim with a
number of irresistible and debilitating temporary effects. These include
inducing vertigo, silence, fire vulnerability, stat drain, or an aversion to
drinking potions. The dreaded clear moon pie will even make any adventurer as
fragile as its delicate flaky crust.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in
their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They

%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>

of death, painfully draining the victim. The caster, too, will find their health
reduced, until they gain enough experience to recover.
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

Animates the weapon of a targeted foe, ripping it from their hands and causing
it to attack them relentlessly. Once the target dies, the weapon will fall to
the ground shortly thereafter.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be animated, and any properties that
require skill in evocations will not be active.
%%%%
Twisted Resurrection spell

creations.

around, slither, etc. Only motile creatures can cast this spell.
%%%%
Vhi's Electric Charge spell

Sends the caster hurtling at a chosen nearby enemy, launching a high-accuracy
melee attack on arrival. Additional electric damage will be dealt based on the
length of the charge, the power of the spell, and the physical damage of the
attack. The caster is wrapped in an envelope of twisted space, allowing them
to safely pass through creatures, traps, and harmful terrain, and to displace
creatures at their destination. The time taken by the spell is the greater of
the time needed to move one step or that needed to launch one melee attack.
%%%%
Vitrify spell

Renders a creature's body structure as brittle and fragile as glass, increasing
the damage they take from all sources.
%%%%
Vitrifying Gaze spell

sight but not line of fire.
%%%%
Volley of Thorns spell

%%%%
Waterstrike spell

Causes the water around or under the target to violently swirl, dealing damage.

Yara's Violent Unravelling spell

If cast upon a creature already blessed (or cursed) with magical enchantments,
those enchantments will be torn apart, transforming into a spray of
destructive mutagenic radiation. The victim and anyone adjacent will be
blasted and heavily deformed, weakening them and reducing their armour.
Summoned creatures are particularly vulnerable, as the enchantments binding
them to this plane will unravel and cause them to be dismissed immediately.
